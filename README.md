# Welcome to my portfolio
Hi there, thanks for stopping by! This is my portfolio of work (view it here on [ailyntang.github.io](http://ailyntang.github.io). Most of it is through freeCodeCamp (fcc), however there are a few pieces of work which I have taken beyond the scope of fcc.

This site is one of them. Whilst it acts as a place to host all my work, building this site has also been one of my pieces of work I'm proud to display.

It's not perfect, but I'm proud of everything I've been able to implement. It's taught me a lot. Namely that CSS is challenging! 

Please reach out and say hi :)


## Backlog
###CSS: Nav bar
* Now there are four elements, need to update this.
* Also the hamburger logo does nothing when the screen gets too small. There's a huge responsive piece I need to deal with for this portfolio.

###CSS: about links
Style these - right now it's the default and it's pretty ugly.

###CSS: Article links
Style these - right now it's the default and it's pretty ugly.

### HTML: thumbnail links
Right now the links are a mix. Some point to further down the page; others point to CodePen.

All of them open up on a new page. However the ones that point down the page should not open on a new page.


### CSS: portfolio image
At the moment, everything is positioned fixed to the top, rather than to each other.

This is because I used `position: relative` with the mockup of the website header bar (`className='mockupWebsite'`). As this is not the parent of this section, I wasn't sure how to relatively position everything after this. 

### CSS: not responsive
The portfolio section is set to 450px wide. Currently it's not responsive.

### CSS: shadow around the mockup
