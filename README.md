# Welcome to my portfolio
Hi there, thanks for stopping by! This is my portfolio of work (view it here on [ailyntang.github.io](http://ailyntang.github.io). Most of it is through freeCodeCamp (fcc), however there are a few pieces of work which I have taken beyond the scope of fcc.

This site is one of them. Whilst it acts as a place to host all my work, building this site has also been one of my pieces of work I'm proud to display.

It's not perfect, but I'm proud of everything I've been able to implement. It's taught me a lot. Namely that CSS is challenging! 

Please reach out and say hi :)
